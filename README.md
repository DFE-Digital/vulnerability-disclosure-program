# vulnerability-disclosure-program

This is an attempt to create a hosted security.txt and thanks.txt as part of the DfE vulnerability disclosure program.

The idea is based on the [GDS/Cabinet Office centrally hosted PaaS project for VDP](https://github.com/alphagov/security.txt). The difference being, this project will be hosted on an Azure Storage static site, due to PaaS now being decommissioned. 

## Design Decisions

The site will be:

* deployed by terraform
* use github actions for ci
* changes can be made via pull request
* files to be hosted in Azure Storage
