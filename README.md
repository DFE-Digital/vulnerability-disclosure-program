# Vulnerability Disclosure Program

This is project to create a hosted security.txt and thanks.txt as part of the DfE vulnerability disclosure program.

The idea is based on the [GDS/Cabinet Office centrally hosted PaaS project for VDP](https://github.com/alphagov/security.txt). The difference being, this project will be hosted on an Azure Storage static site, due to PaaS now being decommissioned. 

## Usage for DfE Services

You can either:

* use the following origin for your site's `/.well-known/security.txt`:
https://vdp.education.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt # TBC DNS record

* do a 302 redirect to:
https://vdp.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt # TBC DNS record

This is so that we can update the security.txt from one place. You may also wish to do the same origin or redirect for thanks.txt.

## security.txt

If there are issues with the security.txt and you'd like to make amendments, simply make your changes locally or in the UI, and then raise a pull request to this repository. You can choose the checkbox marked "update security.txt file" in the template.

## thanks.txt

The thanks.txt file is there to announce thanks to researchers who have helped us to find and fix vulnerabilities. In order to list a thank you, simply make your changes locally or in the UI, and then raise a pull request to this repository. 

Changes should be added per line, and in the format: `[yyyy-mm-dd] Name -- description`

You can choose the checkbox marked "update thanks.txt file" in the template.

## Design Decisions

The site will be:

* deployed by terraform
* use github actions for ci
* changes can be made via pull request
* files to be hosted in Azure Storage
